The Human Controlled Robot, HuCon for short, is able to program in two ways. Depending on the individuals programming skills. For beginners it is recommended to describe the running program with Blockly. Once you have gained experience, the HuCon can be programmed with python. The robot can be programmed over a simple web interface. All you need is a modern browser. This ensures independence from the users system. The interface is optimized for the use with a PC or a tablet but it will work on smart-phones, too. We made sure that the interfaces were arduino compatible. This allows you to use standard products that don't cost much money. We wish you a lot of fun programming your HuCon robot.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"This project was created to teach children how to program a self-built robot.

The kit contains the following components: Omega2+ from Onion HuCon boards Pin header Attention It may be that the pin header is too long. In this case it must be shortened to the correct length of 16 pins. It is recommended to solder the pin headers to the boards before removing them of the panel. The boards can be cut with a small side cutter at the marked places after this. The extend of separation can be removed with a small file. This will let your roboter stand more secure later on. Afterwards the robot can be assembled as shown in the following picture. First the boards (except the head) are assembled. On the boards there are small numbers documenting the assembly. If you look at the robot from below and all the numbers fit together, then you have put the boards together correctly. After the correct board assembly the Omega2+ is inserted into the pin headers. The sd card slot has to face upwards. The Hucon is able to stand on it's own if assembled correctly and will not tip over backwards. Now all you have to do is put your head on your HuCon and it's done.","title":"Assembling"},{"location":"assembling/#assembling","text":"Usually your HuCon comes to you as a kit.

The power delivery can be made with an micro USB cable and a standard smartphone charger with an ampere rating of 500 milliamps. The LEDs on the head should light up/turn red shortly after supplying the power and indicate that the system is booting. The LEDs will soon show yellow and green while the webservice is starting and finally turn off when your HuCon is up and ready to go. Connect to the WLAN Your HuCon provides its own network where you can log in with your PC, tablet or mobile phone. The network name always starts with Omega- XXXX . The last four characters are highlighted bold on the back of your HuCon and the network password is always 12345678 . Your HuCon is providing a homepage on port 8080 and can be reached after you have connected to the WLAN of your HuCon at http://Omega-XXXX.local:8080 or http://192.168.3.1:8080.","title":"Connect"},{"location":"connect/#connect","text":"Before you can work with the HuCon, it has to be powered up and running.

This can be found at https://github.com/basler/hucon/releases under Assets. Save the two files, onionIoT-[version]-hucon-[version].bin and update_flash.sh, on your SD card. Installation Assemble your HuCon and insert the SD card into the slot provided by your robot. This is located at the top of the neck of your HuCon. Then you can connect your HuCon to your computer with a USB cable. Now you can open MobaXterm and click on Sessions . The following window will open where you have to set the com-port and the speed. Warning If you do not have a USB Serial Port in your list, then you have to install the driver for the HuCon. The HuCon is equipped with a USB to serial converter from FTDI . You can find the appropriate driver here . As soon as you click on OK the following picture will appear: That is all right, too. Your robot only answers when you tell it something. Press Enter and your robot should answer. This will look similar to this: Now you are on the command line of your robot. You surely know this from other games or movies, because now you have full control over the system. To update the software of your HuCon you have to enter the following two commands in the console of MobaXterm and execute them: mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt sh /mnt/update_flash.sh After the second command there will be a lot of output on the console and your HuCon will be restarted once during this procedure. This process can take up to 5 minutes until your HuCon is ready for operation again. You can see whether your HuCon has been restarted by looking at the eye of your HuCon. As soon as the HuCon boots the eyes turn red. When the server starts to start, the eyes turn orange and when everything is ready, the eyes turn green for a short time before they go out again. Warning Please note that you are not disconnecting your HuCon from the computer all the time. Otherwise it could be that it is broken afterwards.","title":"First setup"},{"location":"initial_setup/#first-setup","text":"What is needed: USB cable Terminal program ( MobaXterm (Windows) or screen (MacOs & Linux)) Micro SD card Internet connection for downloading the HuCon image","title":"First setup"},{"location":"initial_setup/#preparation","text":"To install the new software on your HuCon you first have to download it from our gitHub repository.
